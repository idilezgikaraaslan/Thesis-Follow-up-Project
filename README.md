# Thesis-Follow-up-Project

### Roadmap

* Generate CMB simulations based on the ideal Planck spectrum.
* Contain the cosmic birefringence angle from each simulation (around 100-1000 simulations)
* Plot the distribution of the angle $\beta$ on a histogram
* Detect the STD of $\beta$ from the histogram
  
   -> For $D_\ell^{EB}$, $D_\ell^{TB}$ and the joint estimator $D_\ell^{EB+TB}$
* Compare STDs with the analytical results obtained in the thesis.
